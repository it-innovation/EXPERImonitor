How to obtain the OWLIM libraries
=================================

For licensing reasons, the OWLIM lite libraries are not contained in this archive.
They can be obtained directly from Ontotext:

1.	Register at http://www.ontotext.com/owlim/owlim-lite-registration for a copy.
	A zip file will be send to you by email after your registration.

2.	Extract the file owlim-lite-5.4.jar from the /lib directory and 
	openrdf-workbench.war and openrdf-sesame.war from the /sesame_owlim
	directory in the zip file into the /thirdPartyLibs directory.

The thirdPartyLibs folder should then contain these additional files:

  * owlim-lite-5.4.jar
  * openrdf-sesame.war
  * openrdf-workbench.war
