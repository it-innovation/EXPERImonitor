			"did not daniel say about the king of the north and the south? also mathew 24/3 talk of end of days .earth quakes .war. revolution.etc have a look at the bible .forget 2012 .nostradamus. the acult and all that sh#t.dont wish to go on but you tube have bible prophasies.go on i dare ",
			"This is another festering wound; created and mainatained by the so called World Powers. The biggest threat to World peace is not nationalism or terrorism - it is the errosism of the Bully Nations who think that they can phiss in other peoples' back yards and not get a splash back! The Russionas, the Chinese, the Americans and yes - the crafty Europeans have all kept the two Koreas divided for mean ideological gains. Now that this policy is proven to be a fools errand they want to get out - but it ain't gonna be that easy. The solutions are threfold: [1] Maintain the status quo - to stop another blood-bath [2] Help the South - after all the North is favoured by the rich Bullies [3] Create an environmnet where the two sides can talk to one anohter - they are one people! Finally - stop INTERFERRING IN OTHER CoUNTries!!! ",
			"I am sure that America will take a measured response over this issue, try not to act foolhardy and most importantly only act under factual information...actually, s@#$% that, lets just watch America bundle into another country...still, a world war would be good for the economy...and money is all that seems to matter these days ",
			"in this day and age nothing surprises me the same way of a report the other week of america dropping supplies of to the Taliban in the Guardian newspaper, or israel selling nuces to a than aprathied south africa the only nuclear armed country in the middle east, for all we know that torpedo could have been a american one in a age were false flag attacks are on the the rise, people can call me a some mad conspriacy theorist but believe me theres a lot a of dark forces at work out there and we the brain washed public believe everything we see and read in the media... ",
			"'''''Something doesn't quite sit right about this to me. If North Korea wanted to secretly attack South Korea, why would it use torpedoes which could easily be identified as its own? And if it did in fact launch the torpedo, why would it bother denying it? North Korea, as we've seen in the past week, is not the most timid of countries, so it strikes me as strange that the latter could be the case.''''' __ Why would they deny it ???? to avoid trade restrictions from other countries ya brainbox !!! ",
			"Post 1. When Nostradamus talked about the Third World War coming from the Far East, maybe he meant the Middle East cos then it would have been the Far East to him. Wot do you think? That is what I think it meant. When he talked about Hitler, he said Hisler, which is a river in Germany. So maybe he did get it right. I just wish people would get on with each other. I find war beyond stupid. Sandy. ",
			"They should long time ago cut of north from all help. It's stupid to give anything to the enemy who hate you. They should let any tourists or investments there as well it's only financing the regime. One threat...South gives... another need in North new threat USA gives...hehe. Is anybody see there any pattern or is it only me? It's a joke. If they want to live in the middle ages..let them. And yes they will have hunger, camps but you know what... we all have to take responsibility for our countries if they not willing to do it or change there are places where people can actually appreciate our help. ",
			"The recent Chinese diplomatic visit to S.Korea shows that the next big boy on the bloc is about to show his muscle, and when he takes his place, we may look back at least on enlightened self interest as a good motive, compared to pure self interest which will then be the main principle in strategic decisions. Forget right & wrong, these are just passe, and while each side shouts against the other, the devil will move in to pole position. Goodbye little man and all your opinions, but the question may remain, how did this ever happen to us? mdm ",
			"I agree with Karlloughrans comments. Does any one remember Hitler and the Nazis. Trumped up charges against Poland was one of the main reasons for World War II. The USA and The CIA have a lot to answer for. Think of the Sadham Weapons of mass Destruction. The USA Plan was to get control of OIL. Where are these terrible weapons.? Does anyone except The USA and CIA know. As for South Korea doing OK on their own. Wake up ! ! It's the USA and the rest of the finacial world who are keeping South Korea going. You lot should ask different questions. And not blindly follow the biggest propogranda machine the world as ever know. They put Hitler to shame. ",
			"It seems to me that China faces a dilemma over north Korea and finding its self being wrong footed by a rogue state that it has openly supported since the 1950s and with saving face becoming more important than ever because of it, as we would say court between the devil and the deep blue sea dammed if she dose and dammed doesn't so perhaps the way forward would be to have its friend north Korea to accept responsibility for it actions issue an apology for its mistake and promise to make restitution towards the family's of the sailor's that where killed who knows things can change! and maybe the start to the cooling of tensions ",
			"wanted for treason blair prestcot brown straw flint reid hewitt collaborators and there enforcers the price is working stubbing out blairs legacy and labours war of mass destruction imposed on liberty respect tolerance equality identity compassion democracy integrity united kingdom who gave who the right to impose persecution bullying abuse and the deaths of innocent people under their controlled democracy are traitors have no elusions they are accountable for this so this is your better united kingdom as in war you pay the price for liberty its not what we want its what thay gave in memory of anthony mcdermott who was bullied and persecuted into suicide and hanged himself and all others so this is your new healthy united kingdom to all parties protect demands liberty and movments reinstated no liberty no peace lest they forgot no compromise this is an afront to our forfathers from protect health before wealth ",
			"Perhaps the solution lies with a precedent? Why not see what punishment was dished out to the US silors who 'accidentally' downed an Iranian passenger aircraft in the full view of a Canadian TV Film company? They had to dish the bodies - many of them women and children - out of the water ... ",
			"If North Korea wanted to secretly attack South Korea, why would it use torpedoes which could easily be identified as its own? And if it did in fact launch the torpedo, why would it bother denying it? I totally agree. There is something else behind all this ",
			"It was China, not Russia, who came to the aid of the communists in the north of Korea in 1950-53. (Mickey.Finn, comment #7). Russia supplied the equipement yes but you are right in saying that they did not fight side by side as the American and UN elements did with South Korea. I think we can forgive the author of the report for a lack of historical insight. ",
			"It does seem odd that South Korea finds evidence that strongly suggests that North Korea is responsible for the sinking of the South?s vessel. If such is the case then why would the North bother to deny the attack? They could easily expand on reasons for the attack that would leave open a longer period of time for negations whilst maintaing a strong position. With the size of the North?s army the South would need a UNSC resolution and support. This so called attack gives the South that opportunity. I can?t help thinking its like the south is moving pieces of a chess board into a position favourable to them; e.g. proximity of allies, the UN, the sinking, politics. For me it?s also suspicious that this has all happened whilst South Korea has a Leader that has openly negative views on the Leadership of the North. Whist we in the West might share those views, we in the west are not North Koreas neighbours. Prudence and carful consideration expressing ones opinions in such a political and geographical position would seem to be the course of wisdom. It all seems to point to an increasing negativity on the Souths behalf toward the North. But they know the can not act alone. What would you do? you would give a clear reason for the support! ",
			"Why don't the north just grow up and act like a responsible country, if it was an accidentally fired torpeado that stuck the ship, then say so, appologise for it and make some effort to restore the fragile peace. if it was intentional then say 'we are at war, with the south, blow the hell out of it and risk a retaliation they can not stand. please excuse any spelling mistakes am dyslexic ",
			"We may not want one...but we NEED a world war ! People have a right to live in a world free of tyranny and hunger.Something however costly is actually worth dying for. There are tens of million people being abused in China...Islam is again attempting to send society back to the dark ages.We need someone strong to say enough is enough. That may play to the paranormal lovers of prophecy and 2012 doomsdaysayers,antichrist etc.But the world is fooked when good men do nothing ",
			"what a @#$% article from the consistently uninformed yahoo moron. if you checked your history, you would find that the north koreans have been responsible for a number of killings and sinkings of ships over the last few decades. also, if the north koreans didnt fire that torpedo, who did? who would benefit? the north korean president is on the verge of death, and has become even more reckless. the south have had a policy for years of trying to build a lasting peace. instead of relying on your own lack of intellect, try taking in the news from bbc, channel 4, and cnn. far more reliable than the @#$% you peddle. ",
			"Is anyone else s**t scared of a third World War, well technically the forth, but think about it, N.Korea, Russia and China backing a country who hates S.Korea and the US, and the UN will join the US so will the UK and most NATO countries who aren't members of the UN ",
			"Seven years on we're still waiting for those weapons of mass destruction to turn up. I think you're the only one still waiting for them...Everyone else has by now realised, what the rest of us did, that both Bush and Blair lied to us! This is a terrible escalation. The UN must send a peace envoy to North Korea and ask them and the South, to get around the same table for a chat, with both Russia and China exerting pressure for this round of peace talks to happen IMMEDIATELY. ",
			"In a perfect world...China should be forced into addressing its human rights abuses....however the West is more comfortable in promoting democracy to lesser countries. My own beleief is we should crush dictatorships as a free people wherever we find tyranny.It makes complete economic sense for another global war,the second world war didn't address the big issues and what remained required we finished the job. ",
			"just another political pile of bull@#$% to me leave then to it and all apparent supporting countrys stay the hell out none of your buisness especially the yanks who get involved in everything then drag british into it also everyone else ",
			"I wouldn't be surprised if it was the Americans who torpedoed the warship, in order to stir up trouble with North Korea. They are looking for an excuse for war to take down the rogue leader who is possibly a threat to world peace. or maybe stir up trouble with Russia and China. In the next few years they will need to pull out of Afghanistan so they will be looking for somewhere else to send their troops. ",
			"I agree with the article in that we have to step back and examine the evidence carefully. The Russians do seem to have the right approach here. The article does assume that in order for the attack to have been launched by the North Koreans there must have been a level of rationality at work. With these things it can be the opposite. Perhaps it was an accident? A loose canon commander? A @#$%-up? Or a deliberate act of aggression or a stitch-up? Miliraily the North's greatest asset is also a weakness. It's huge but not very well equipped army would rely on overwhelming the South rapidly - which they are capable of doing. If however, the North was subjected to a blockade, and the South with the help of her allies could at least hold the North off, then that massive army would start becoming a liabilty to the North. Anything could then happen. The key word here though is 'if'. The North Koreans just have so much to throw at the South, that I'm not sure they could be held off. ",
			"Still waiting to find weapons of mass destruction, did you not know about the gas attack, you know Sadam Hussain's brother, or do you look for hidden land mines by walking about stamping on the ground with big boots and having your eyes closed? ",
			"remember how the states got officially invovled in the Vietnam war, it rigged up some scenario involving provocation in the Gulf of Tonkin which ended up with a North Vietnamese gunship retaliating and opening up on American personnel, this was deemed by the Americans as an act of war....and so it began, 10 years of non sensical war ending in the deaths of 58,000 Americans and some 2 million Vietnamese...is it now Korea's turn? ",
			"It's probably the reptiles aliens at work behind North Korea versus the grays which are in control of South Korea. Those two hostile extraterrestrial factions need to sort themselves out for peace in the galaxy and on our planet. The planetary changes are upon us and we need to send brotherly love vibes to both countries and both alien races, that might help usher the New Age (Aquarius) without (too much) bloodshed. ",
			"I have seen the way the repressed hatred and anger of these people manifests itself. They hang and torture innocent dogs for consumption instead of just killing them quickly. Their public protests and strikes involve ripping apart live animals as a show of emotion. It's about time they had an outlet for their anger. GET STUCK IN! Happy shooting to both sides. This one's for all the tortured dogs! ",
			"The End of the earth before I see my wife and nany NO? NO? I do not beleive this Shock as royal favourite Sir Norman Wisdom's treasures are sold for 'peanuts' Valuable memorabilia of Sir Norman Wisdom, the Palace jester, has been quietly auctioned off at knockdown prices. Now let us talk. All the Time we talk of London being dirty and full of snobs. This beats the lot. Read on then decide who is rich. I said this and say this again. BRIC Brazil India China and Russia are now the superpowers and will lead us out of the rubbish we are in I thank you Firozali A.Mulla DBA ",
			"What is this proof that the US is claiming proves that the North sank the ship? Same sort of proof that led us into Iraq? The Americans are liars! Gulf of Tomkin, Operation Northwoods, and the list goes on... America get your nose out of Koreas business! Go Home! Live in peace and dont mess with soverign nations. This is Koreas, Russia's and Chinas concern. If this war goes hot then expect the south to burn for a week while the North unleashes its huge artillery force. The south does have better tech though so im not sure who would win this. hopefully this will defuse, but with the Americans pushing this evidence im not so sure ",
			"Hey Journo Nutjob. What are you thinking putting an irresponsible title like 'North and South Korea prepare for war' across the front page of Yahoo. You've made it sound like war is about to commence. Nowhere in events has this been said. Threats of war but neither have said we are preparing for war. Stop sensationalizing things to keep your hits high and your salary higher. Be responsible...nutter. ",
			"Yet another example of the impotence of the UN. The UN should be telling the US and China to keep their beaks out and let Korea sort out its own problems. The UN should be telling the nutter running the north to wake up and join the 21st Century. ",
			"The problem with this article is that it suggests that the North isn?t responsible for the Torpedo incident. However that leaves a problem and some unlikely alternatives including South Korea is responsible, this means it faked the explosion with a North Korean Torpedo in such a way to fool the international community (including killing 46 of its own men) and threatening to pulverise itself and with the artillery ranged against it along the DMZ or (as was in the case of the shooting of the South Korean tourist in July 2008and the axe welding soldier at Panmunjom in 76) some low level commander got trigger happy and unleashed hell and has trapped the NK leadership in it?s own guile and a war it neither can afford or wants, either way no one wins!

",
			"As someone who has lived in Korea and has connections, I can tell you now that it is the present dictatorship in SOUTH KOREA that is once again manipulating the people. Unfortunately the sinking is a fabrication because Elections (local) are due and this government under its right wing policies uses fear to intimidate and control. The press is being controlled in the SOUTH when are the press and other countries going to wake up to the fact that the hosts of the next G7 talks is in fact a dictator who is stopping free speech. Mark ",
			"North Korea is a starving Country. It's people are turning against it and the majority of Countries in the World are against it. Not many other Countries in the World can you buy human flesh over the counter. It's internal structure has collapsed and the only thing effective left is the Army. I don't think it see's South Korea (or even the USA) as a threat, but more of an excuse to cover up the failures of a regime which has, over many years totally destroyed a Country. Perhaps the best thing to do is openly help the North Korean people and let them see the rest of the World is not against them and let it be them that brings down the Government. Sounds easy but look at Thailand -it's a mess and the situation in North Korea would be a million times harder than Thailand. If the USA and China got together and helped North Korea it would work. South Korea are handling things very well because lets face it, apart from their neighbours in the North, they are doing ok. ",
			"The editor's points are valid. The US and S Korea have not refuted the points of denial put up by N Korea. The investigation was by people from countries hostile to N Korea and China and therefore lacks credibility. solomonl02 ",
			"It was China, not Russia, who came to the aid of the communists in the north of Korea in 1950-53. (Mickey.Finn, comment #7). Actually, Mickey, they both did. The Soviet Union was where all those T34/85s and MiG 15s came from. The above article - and one or two of the comments - are in the great British tradition of insulting our friends and pandering to dictatorships. Think Chaimberlain and Munich, think Harold Wilson's first overseas visit as PM - to Moscow, think Benn and Galloway fawning to Saddam in the 1990s. Beyond the usual lunatic gibberibg from Pyongyang and the pettifogging of hostile governments (China and Russia) there is no reasonable doubt that a DPRK submarine torpedoed the corvette Cheonan. Just *why* this happened, and on whose orders remains a mystery. It is possible that Kim Jong-Il and his circle themselves do not know, and that the attack was initiated by rogue or disaffected elements within the military. North Korea is approaching a crossroads, with an ailing dictator and no clear line of succession; more instability is to be expected. Dan Ibekwe, Manchester UK ",
			"Matthew 24 'Wars and rumours of wars.' Kingdom against kingdom'. all happening now in our time in a far greater number than present history shows. When these things begin to happen look up! God is calling time soon and none of you want to see it. The bible is not rubbish or fantasy! Famines and earthquakes in diverse places! All there to be seen. it holds prophetic truth and is even now proving itself . Time to get right with our Maker? Definitely because time as we see it is running out and the unbelievers will be left behind to what? somethings that I personally dont want to join. Take salvation now before the door closes. abuse me if you must for this; but you will one day see the truth of it. I just wish you could see it before its too late for I hate no one. I want to see all saved and safe! heaven is still better than this. Jesus loves you. ",
			"I agree with comment number 9, which could weel be an answer to the quesion, why? However, the submarine that sent the torpedo must have had a crew and a captain. where are they? Who are they? If, as coment 9 sujests, they were a group of militairs who want some action, then they are probably dead by now. If they are not, then they were sent by the government. Please, no more war! ",
			"In response to jamejunrit comments, war, plague and pestilence, earthquakes and natural disasters have been happening since Jesus was born. 2000 years on and anyone can make obscure predictions like that. Closed minds produce closed comments like yours, ",
			"jamejunrit i'm with you on this one, everyone on this planet has to look inside themselves, and consider am i a good person to my family, friends, neighbour, or stranger, what can i do to make anothers life better, happier, instead of looking to our own greed. we have to change stop the excesses of drink, drugs and and other things that just waste our time and money and in the end they are just things. what is of the most value is each other. there is a day of judgement and we will be questioned what have we done with our life, and to those around us. ",
			"Seven years on we're still waiting for those weapons of mass destruction to turn up .Please, lets get one thing straight. There were weapons of mass distruction used by the Sadam regime. If you do not believe me, ask the Kurds! ",
			"Has anybody seen that Korean drama IRIS?, its like the asian series of 24, absolutely brilliant!. Anyway, it talks a bout a story of a secret terrorist group who wants to start a war between the North and the South of Korea, thus the group carries out a series of terrorist activities to make ppl think its the North Korean army who done it. This article makes me think that there is more to the truth than meets the eye a la IRIS. ",
			"Quite what God and Jesus and the other chaps from the over rated fictional novel THE BIBLE have got to do with this I do not know. I can see only human beings in control of this situation and if war is the only way that these two can sort it out, so be it-GET IT ON. The bible says lots of things. You should head down into the Egyptian tombs and read al that is in the bible-only three thousand years before it was written. That is a bit of a bummer to all you bible pushers. Fabrication and hand me down letters..eerrmmm! ",
			"well u never know.. i know if i was god this world is corrupt on all levels and it proves with humanitity we will never change.....we had a second chance after the flood but time again we let the creator dwn ....god and jesus rules........ ",
			"Something dosen't quite sit right about this. Gee, who writes this stuff, eh? Clearly, these so-called 'leaders' are little more than neurotic, attention-seeking, cunning, divisive, power-crazed, egocentric lunatics. Give em all a lollypop, tell em they've been naughty boys, and send em to bed...for a very long time. Thing is, theres a famine in the north, and since the nutter 'leader' is to arrogant and therefore proud to ask for international assistance, it throws a childish paddy.. Gee, how come we all end up with such precious leaders, eh? I do feel for the peeps of North Korea, though...having to live under such a self-rightous, self-important nutter. Yet with the south re-acting in such a stereo-typical manner, then their all as bad as each other. I guess Clinton will be sticking her nose and wooden spoon in soon. When oh when will humanity grow up and behave in such a way that supposidly represents an intelligent species? Beam me up Scotty...its a nice planet, but its covered with humaniods, and their mostly friggen bonkers! ",
			"This is a typical US / Western World supremacy bullying stance to infiltrate North Korea and perhaps wipe them out! I am not up for any wars and pray for peace. However if the war is allowed, China & Russia, who are right on this occasion and pertaining to the validity of S.Koren(US) claims, the US ought to be told and taught a lesson that they do NOT rule the world nor they'll ever do! Mr. US, stop being scums and let the world live in peace and harmony...if not...hope a lesson is taught to you!!!! Mr. Obama, remember your grass roots from Kenya?I am a Kenyan?the very nation you represent slaved and killed your great great grandparents! ",
			"jamejunrit if god cares so much why would he bother killing us all ? what i dont get is... why does everyone follow a book that itself could have been changed to suit the needs of others ? just because its a relgion doesnt meen its safe from corruption ",
			"N korea if finished witjout the surport of china and Russia but with their support it's hard to say ho this 'war' might end up, because i think other countries such as GB will join in and spoil the fun. ",
			"As to the Editors remarks about something not right about the sinking, it's probably already been said, but these people don't think like we do, or vice versa. Their whole view of life is alien to our way of thinking, not necessarily wrong (see-it's complicated), but different. This includes the whole communist philosophy and paranoia that followed WW2. Not a lot of thinking has changed in some parts of the world since those long gone days. ",
			"I totally agree with the article. The attack was direct with hard evidence showing where it is coming from. But why would a perfect usual suspect use their own torpedo that is very easy to identify. I don't think it need experts to identifier the weapon . They just took their time to make it look as if it was a long investigation. People shouldn't just draw conclusion about who sunk the ship. USA can do it or can get this right wing South Korean government to do it. Yes indeed they ( far rights) can even kill their own people just to push in their agenda.The last thing they care about is people. We have seen the truth of the Ira k invasion and events surrounding 9/11 still one of the biggest conspiracy of modern times. Thank god we still have Russia and China to try to stop USA and its friends from systematically destroy the planet. ",

Sabre rattling has been vogue between the two cousins for over 50 years and the North has been guilty of many things during that time, including spies living in the UK. If you truthfully believe that the South would make such allegations with its neighbouring Nuclear Armed cousin that has a strong military body, who incidentally are extremely well fed, then my friend you are a fool !

			"appello di Francesco Miglino, presidente del Comitato Promotore ERA INTERNETTIANA Appello all?UNESCO affinchè L?UNIVERSO INTERNETTIANO, LA RETE, IL DIRITTO ALL? ACCESSO siano dichiarati PATRIMONIO UNIVERSALE DELL? UMANITA?. Noi Donne ed Uomini abitanti della terra, a@#$% responsabilmente confrontato la qualità della nostra vita prima della creazione dell? universo internettiano con quella di oggi, testimoniamo che la nostra vita è diventata più ricca, intelligente e partecipativa delle sorti della società e del globo che ora percepiamo come casa comune da gestire e proteggere perchè controllabile e raggiungibile in ogni suo angolo. Usciti dal nostro habitat, affacciati alla nostra finestra sul mondo, possiamo comunicare in tempo reale in modo bidirezionale e complesso, informarci, attingere ed allargare i nostri saperi, compiere operazioni logistiche che prima sottraevano tempo prezioso alla nostra quotidianità. Possiamo dichiarare in tutta coscienza che oggi, senza l? universo internettiano la qualità della nostra esistenza sarebbe come quella di un uomo privato delle connessioni sinaptiche poichè e? l? universo internettiano il più formidabile ed organico acceleratore di consapevolezza con cui è possibile acquisire saperi, realizzare scelte coscienti, incontrarsi ed unirsi ad altri uomini che reclamano progresso, giustizia e diritti da ogni angolo della terra e che progettano la costruzione di una società evoluta, colta e libera. Le informazioni, prima affidate alla mediazione interessata dei possessori delle rotative, ora sono dirette e fanno luce con do@#$%enti probanti su problemi volutamente irrisolti e nascosti dal distorcente egoismo dei poteri dominanti. Da ogni angolo della terra sperduto e prima ignorato dove si pratica la violenza dell? uomo sull? uomo, le vittime possono spezzare la solitudine facendo giungere la testimonianza delle proprie sofferenze nell? universo internettiano. E? scientificamente provato che è stato l?allargamento della nostra corteccia celebrale a favorire una più organica ed evoluta organizzazione delle sinapsi del nostro cervello ed a permettere che il soddisfacimento dei bisogni fisiologici non avvenisse più con il ricorso alle pulsioni istintuali, affrancandoci dalla schiavitù della nostra genetica. E? scientificamente provato che i miliardi di flussi sinaptici creati da miliardi di uomini che s? incontrano nell? universo internettiano allargano la circolazione delle idee e dei saperi e l? uomo progredisce poichè liberato dalla schiavitù dell? ignoranza, da limitanti pregiudizi localistici, brutalità censorie, avvilenti disinformazioni pilotate da interessi precostituiti spesso antisociali. Con la libera comunicazione nell? universo internettiano neutrale ogni uomo può emanciparsi, aumentare i neurotrasmettitori cerebrali in modo proporzionale al numero di quesiti enunciati e risolti da risposte competenti donate in rete, stimolare l? intelligenza creativa in ogni campo, approfondire esperienze diverse in luoghi prima irraggiungibili, confrontare pensieri e postulati seguiti da esaustive elaborazioni dialettiche e risposte congrue in tempo reale, accedere a banche dati, immergersi in variegate esplorazioni professionalizzanti con il conseguente aumento delle spine dendriniche e la creazione di nuovi punti d? attracco per la connessione ed attivazione di altre cellule nervose. Il cervello umano è il paradigma dell? attività sinaptica viva e palpitante animata in modo incessante da miliardi di connessioni di esseri umani che abitano e qualificano l? universo internettiano, gli stessi che, pervasi da un gratificante rapporto empatico verso gli altri, determinano il flusso informativo qualificato e l? offerta ad ampio raggio dei saperi favorendo il miglioramento della nostra specie con la crescita addizionale di neuroni e delle connessioni nella nostra corteccia celebrale. Oggi l? uomo scopre che la qualità della propria esistenza è proporzionale alla conoscenza e si rende conto che solo i saperi lo svincolano da assuefazioni sociali primordiali e lo esortano a costruire un nuovo modus vivendi in cui prioritarie siano le scelte benefiche coscienti per il bene comune. Relazionandosi nell? universo internettiano l? uomo che incontra la generosità in offerte creative gratuite, acquisisce il rispetto degli altri ed abbandona gli impulsi distruttivi, intuendo che, liberandosi dagli istinti predatori e dal cinismo, si può convivere in armonia, razionalizzare l? uso delle risorse, superare collettivamente la limitante lotta per il solo soddisfacimento dei bisogni elementari e, per la prima volta, sedersi collegialmente nell? agorà universale a riflettere sul come organizzare il proprio destino. Nella storia di tutti i tempi mai l ? uomo ha creato un supremo e grandioso universo in cui immergersi svincolato finalmente da condizionanti ed opprimenti gerarchizzazioni sociali ed in assoluta libertà formarsi, esprimersi, rappresentarsi e realizzarsi facendo giungere il proprio apporto in ogni angolo del globo. Stabilito che l? universo internettiano è bene comune come l? aria e l? acqua, creato dall? uomo per il progresso dell? uomo, chiediamo all? UNESCO di proteggerlo da ingerenze e censure e di preservarne la neutralità dichiarando ?PATRIMONIO UNIVERSALE DELL? UMANITA? L? UNIVERSO INTERNETTIANO, LA RETE, IL DIRITTO ALL? ACCESSO.

			"It is clear from some of these comments that opinion is preferred to history. I cannot say historical facts as the winners invariably write history but we now know the truth of the second incident in the Gulf of Tonkin, which, thanks to Lyndon B Johnson, dragged America into the Vietnam War. The question that should have been asked then was a simple, ?Why?? Who stood to gain? Today we would be well to ask that same simple question. The answer may very well have the same roots. Power and money brokers are well hidden but never far from the surface of any war. Who gains what? Follow the money; the trail is there to see - assuming you prefer facts to opinion. And, big clue, none of it has anything to do with mythical beings in the sky! ",
			"The world politics simply is the problem to this event of few days which we have seen. The divide and rule principle that has been instituted into their system as affected their decision making approach. That is why they have missed it completely. For the past one year the media coverage has been on IRAN and believe me they are not a treat has they made us to believe compared to the north korea. I was not surprise seening all this happening, we has citizen of world should make our own decision and believe very little of this media house convey to us. ",
			"It's the oldest trick in the book. North Korea faces economic collapse and famine. It's leaders need to distract the public, so whip up war fever. This is a dangerous game - N Korea is an unstable 'rogue' state and one day will go too far. South Korea might just decide that a pre-empitive strike is in order, and who could blame them? ",
			"This is some really poor political analysis. North Korea has often provoked the south and the south's western allies. It can only maintain its economy if it exists on a permanent war-footing, and even then it's struggling. The whole set up for North Korea requires convincing China, and to a lesser extent Russia, that they are under constant threat from the west. The comparison with Iraq is also extremely spurious, as North Korea is a confirmed nuclear state. You don't have to find their WMD, they'll show them to you. ",
			"Firstly to correct an earlier statement. In the first Korean War China supplied ground troops and limited air support, Russia provided the bulk of the air support. Both only joined in when the UN was in danger of pushing the communists to the Chinese border. Hopefully it will not come to war but if it does I suspect that neither China nor Russia will risk military intervention. For Russia it will expose it's military weakness and for China it will destroy it's economy, lead to civil unrest and possibly Taiwan launching an attack. From a tactical point of view the North Korean nuclear threat, navy and airforce will be destroyed within 24 hours. The nuclear threat as soon as indications that the silo's are operative or the mobiles are deployed. So the bottom line is that the war, if any, will be fought on the ground. The USA has ruled out the use of nuclear weapons against mass troop movement. My money is on handbags at 50 paces and business as usual as long as China continues to support North Korea. Perhaps the key is to embargo China until such time as it stops supporting tyranny and oppression ? ",
			"Another point which I think is best made separately is this, the press, since the turn of the 20th century has managed to talk people the world over into going to war. Why? It sells newspapers. Money. I have been in so called ?war situations? and seen for myself how reportred ?facts? are manufactured. Pay little or no heed to the moneygrubbers of the Press. They have but one calling: money! Ah, here we back where I started. ",
			"There seems to be so many different views on how this war is about to happen. Yes it could be a cover up by South Korea or USA. One thing which has stuck in my mind is that British and American stock markets fell dramatically on the annoncement of war in Korea. The western world has a lot more involvement in South Korea than what people think. To try and wipe out North Korea would mean billions in profit to the west. People do not be fooled by properganda. we all have a brain. Even if North Korea did fire the torpedo what good is going to war. We are all nearing the end of our time. Every man and woman is acountable for their actions, Rich or Poor. ",
			"YOUR QUOTE:. Seven years on we're still waiting for those weapons of mass destruction to turn up.How old are you? The bbc did a program before the first Iraq war, they were shipping those weapons/Laborities on planes back and forward into Siria. which is why you would never find them. ",
			"I can't believe what I just read: After all, what did we learn from the Iraq War? If you're planning to go in, make sure you can justify it. Who is WE? The warmongers in Washington learned this lesson- people who don't mind killing hundreds of thousands of people for oil. Reasonable, civilized people don't think like this- ie the majority of humanity. The lesson most people drew from the invasion of Iraq is that agressive wars must be stopped, before they destroy the world. ",
			"This writer should be more careful to post an article like this.I live in South Korea and I don't think there will be war.There have been tensions between South and North Korea for the last few days.But as a matter of fact the tensions are cooling off.The chinese premier and japanese prime minister and South Korean president held a summit today.The ship sinking was talked about.But economic issues were more important subjects.And China who is a main ally of North Korea does not want the war in the region at all since their economy is taking off.An article like this can be harmful for my country.I do not understand how can someone post such an article so easily. ",
			"What a load of idiots they are, why can't people get on with each other this sort of thing makes me sick, there is to much nastyness in the world and to many greedy people war is not necessary if everybody would just get on and not try to take other people over, one day the whole world will be gone. ",
			"I've lived in Seoul for several years. The obsession in the western press with the quantifiable prospect of war does nothing to enlighten anyone and certainly nothing to help this situation. Maybe the North sank the boat but to many here it's far from clear. The ROK govt. has kept all details of the investigation from its citizens from the start. The police are now cracking down on those who are questioning the report on the internet. Had the govt. not repudiated the 2000 and 2007 summits there would have been no need for the ship to be there at all. There is also no-one in government with any experience of inter-Korean affairs. Lee Myung-Bak expelled all the experts when he took office. He is playing an imbecilic game, and has allowed tensions to escalate deliberately so that he can grandstand on national security. Whatever the truth of the Cheonan incident, LMB bears some measure of responsibility. He and the international community have not understood that inter-Korean relations are key to security here. ROK and US policy is now driving the North back into the arms of the Chinese, against all our long-term interests. But China doesn't want war because it doesn't want the unified Korea, albeit of a chaotic kind, that would result. ",

			"This is a typical US / Western World supremacy bullying stance to infiltrate North Korea and perhaps wipe them out! I am not up for any wars and pray for peace. However if the war is allowed, China & Russia, who are right on this occasion and pertaining to the validity of S.Koren(US) claims, the US ought to be told and taught a lesson that they do NOT rule the world nor they'll ever do! Mr. US, stop being s@#$%s and let the world live in peace and harmony...if not...hope a lesson is taught to you!!!! Mr. Obama, remember your grass roots from Kenya?I am a Kenyan?the very nation you represent slaved and killed your great great grandparents! ",
			"There is absolutely no reason why this should mean all-out war. The USA and China should tell their respective client states to calm it down. In the late 1940s the Albanian government mined and almost destroyed two British warships, with many casualties. There was never any question that war would break out, nor should there be in this case. ",
			"I strongly believe that the North Korean government is to blame for this. They indoctrinate the public into what they think is best for the public. Kim Jong ill . has no notion what hes getting into. His country experiencing a famine, they only spend money on machinery than food and health care. I'm surprised that the people haven't declared anarchy against the country. ",
			"Has anyone considered that the torpedo that hit the South Korean vessel could have been fired accidentally?! The reason they are denying it was shot by North Korea is because they want peace- that seems obvious. The only other option is that someone else is deliberately is trying to spark off a conflict in the region- cynically believing that if North and South are attacking each other then they won't be a nuclear threat to anyone else? Please talk peace, to save your people and others from the experience of war, especially your children! ",
			"Who is this editor? And why are Yahoo broadcasting pro-war propaganda? Stick to reporting facts, instead of publishing the views of people like this writer, who get excited by war but have no first hand knowledge of it. ",
			"Some comments regards this causing WW3 are likely to prove to be rather dramatic.I myself am a little dubious regards the evidence - what little I've seen depicts some very rusty parts, very rusty for a torpeodo thats supposed to have been fired only a couple of months ago!!! But thats from what little I've seen. If the North did fire one, was it a rogue Captain? I doubt it, probably isn't equipped with up to date GPS system and was slightly off course in South Korean waters. Whatever, Chinas highly likely to see to it that this doesn't escalate beyond sanctions, Americas too engaged in Afghanistan and is hardly in a financial or military position to risk a war in the region that could escalate into a big war with China. All China has to do is say it won't tolerate an invasion of North Korea and that'll be the end of that idea!!! ",
			"As someone who is actually living in South Korea, I would prefer it if Yahoo would indicate clearly that this is only one person's point of view and not dress it up to make it look like news (none of which it is). The situation here is frightening enough for us anyway. ",
			"I just pray that our government steers clear of any plans the USA might have concerning this situation,we can't afford any more conflicts at the detrement of UK citizens,we just need to concentrate on home issues and sort out this economic mess we are in, if the USA have any sense they will do the same. ",
			"It would be nothing new for the US intelligence agency to have obtained a North Korean torpeado and to have fired it themselves to provoke a war. Sorry to go down the conspiracy theory, but history teaches us that the US have used similar tactics to provoke countries that they wanted to invade for one reason or another! ",
			"I'm unsure that North Korea sank that ship are they the only country with that type of torpedo the NWO have been looking for anything to go to war with another one of the axis of evil so it would no surprise me in the slightest if they (the U.N) sank that S.Korean ship. ",

Korean nationalists wanted the Americans to leave since it was clear the Americans would simply take the place of the Japanese imperialists who had occupied Korea since 1910. The nationalists struggle for independence had actually begun before WWII.

			"This is a very odd article which betrays a lack of knowledge of the two Koreas. It claims that Russia is demanding to see the evidence which convinced an international panel that North Korea is the aggressor. It has no need to demand anything. The South Koreans have offered the evidence to all UN Security Council Members. What is really odd is that China has refused to receive the evidence in the investigatory report.. It asks why the North Koreans would use torpedos easily identified as theirs. For the simple reason that they never imagined that there would be sufficient remains to identify or that the South Koreans would be so lucky as to dredge them up from the seabed in front of a panel of international experts. It asks why the North Koreans should bother denying that it launched the torpedos if they did. For the simple reason that North Koreans always lie when exposed to unpleasant truths. I witnessed this myself in Pyongyang in March. We were told with a straight face that there were no private street markets in the city because the government provided ample food supplies.The next day our hosts inadvertently took us past a street market.Needless to say, they refused to allow us to stop. North Korea is an evil authoritarian regime which is content to see hundreds of thousands of its own citizens die from starvation while being told that they live in a workers paradise.

			"I totally agree with the article. The attack was direct with hard evidence showing where it is coming from. But why would a perfect usual suspect use their own torpedo that is very easy to identify. I don't think it need experts to identifier the weapon . They just took their time to make it look as if it was a long investigation. People shouldn't just draw conclusion about who sunk the ship. USA can do it or can get this right wing South Korean government to do it. Yes indeed they ( far rights) can even kill their own people just to push in their agenda.The last thing they care about is people.

The bible does contain prophetic truth and all that is prophesized will come to pass. I invite those who wish to, to think upon, (where they reason), we are in the history of the world as we know it. It is not fear that I ask you to dwell upon but the possability that the events of our present time are pointing towards the return of God as spoken of in the Bible. Should your reasoning of current world events lead you to enquire of God, then simply ask God to show you the truth by confessing with your mouth that Jesus is the son of God and that you beleive in your heart that God is real and has forgiven you for everything you have done wrong that displeases Him,(your sins) and then by having said this with your mouth and believed this in your heart, you need not be frightened where world events are leading because you now have become a member of God's family and God will supply comfort to His family members by the comfort of God's presence in your heart. No fear required. God is in control even if world events look to be out of control. God offers you peace and calm for the storms (and wars) in our lives. ",

			"This situation calls for more care and patience so that we do not give a wrong dog bad name. The lesson from Iraq is still very fresh in our memories. We all now know that Iraq does not possess WMD as claimed by war-anxious and blood-tasty Bush. We should not fall into trap of halo-effect by using North Korea's recent defiant bhr to rush into conclusion. It may that South itself want to cause confusion or The North wants attention. North Korea is down and poor, and note that he that is down needs fear no fall. The country has little nothing to lose by going into war.

			"While I can see what you mean about it not quite sitting right, strategically and politically it makes sense. If there is some proof then it points the peninsula towards war, while their denial appeases China and Russia somewhat, and perhaps protects them from UN Security council action. Unilateral action by the US, while possible is unlikely with Mr. Obama at the helm, and the EU has no business in the peninsula but does has business with both Russia and China, and so won't go rocking the boat either. The real question is what the North's desired outcome actually is. In all likelihood, the desired outcome is either trade deals, food or other material resources. I can't say that I actually know what came of the promises of humanitarian supplies made to the North in return for the descalation of the mess with Japan, but my guess is that the ultimate goal is either more of the same or the comparative riches of the South. All of this does of course presuppose that it was the North that fired the torpedo. And if not the North, then who? Some people on this thread have suggested that it's a political ploy by the leaders of the South. If it was, then it would be a spectacularly risky move. Ideally such a move would end with the North saber rattling, the West granting trade and humanitarian concessions to shut them up, and good election results for the in@#$%bents. On the other hand it runs the risk of people finding out, which in turn would risk their alliance with the US, or destroy their election results, or both, and either way the North actually going to war, while the North can honestly turn to Russia and China and say 'We didn't do it' and so forestall any UN action. So if not the South then who? Yeah this is the bit where the conspiracy theorists run wild, but ultimately, no one has any real interest in a war in the Koreas. They don't have a vast reserve of natural resources, and most of the world's military powers are flat broke, and/or embroiled in various wars already. The next week will be interesting, that's for certain. ",

We can only hope China and Russia get involved, that'll surely annoy the US, who'll want to get it's allies involved (Especially the UK). To be honest, I don't think China or Russia will get involved, China's not saying anything really and Russia wants evidence North Korea did attack the ship. Hopefully, our new Parliament (I'm speaking as a British citizen) will do the right thing, and stay out of this. If the US wants to get involved, that's their choice, it's a mistake but it's still their choice. And also, there's very little proof of NK actually attack the ship, and as the Editor said, if the North Koreans wanted to attack SK, they'd have done it in a much more secure and stealthy way then torpedo it. For all we know, it could have been a Friendly Fire incident (SK Sub accidentally attacking the ship). But anyway, we shall have to wait and see what happens. ",
			"There's an awful lot of misunderstandings and heresay in these comments. The Chinese actually were fighting in the Korean War, whilst the Russians flew MIG's against the NATO forces.

Facts. The North Korean armed forces are notoriously ill-disciplined, and members have been removed (or disappeared) after persistent provocation of U.S. forces, only, I suspect, as an appeaser. They are not beyond the attack on the naval vessel, don't fool youself. Hopefully the Russians will show more commonsense in the current climate, than they did in the 1950's. ",

			"Let's assume the CIA were behind this, they (and maybe Mossad), are world leaders in this sort of game play, so they would be thinking well beyond the 'public' coming to the conclusion that North Korea wouldn't be daft enough to leave any traceable evidence on the torpedo, and they would be well aware that sooner or later someone will make a comment to this effect as I am doing now. So now you must be thinking am I a CIA operative trying to sway opinion or am I a complete pratt ? Well, I hope you will think I am a level headed guy who doesn't jump to conclusions but is prepared to put forward sensible suggestions. So, first ignore the occasional religious nut that rears it's ugly head in these forums, and instead, consider how they indoctrinate their citizens (including the military) in NK to such a degree that a hatred of the South reaches fanatical proportions. Is it too far fetched to suggest a captain of a NK submarine took it upon himself to sink the SK corvette in the totally misguided belief he is doing this for his mother country and that he will receive a hero's welcome ? Sometimes the simplest explanations turn out to be true (but not if I really do work for the CIA - ha) ! ",

It would suit both these countries very well to have the USA embroiled in yet another war. Yet Russia is also having it's own problems (with Islamist states) in, or bordering on, her bounderies. So it may just sway them into sanctions against N. Korea. I think one thing is for certain, N.Korea probably would use nuclear weapons should it evolve into all out war. Thus the USA would respond in the same way - and China would respond to that.

Russia supplied the equipement yes but you are right in saying that they did not fight side by side as the American and UN elements did with South Korea. I think we can forgive the author of the report for a lack of historical insight. * Um, the UN forces were fighting on the South Korean side due to the UN resolution that was passed, due to the South being a victim of unprovoked aggression from North Korea. Also there are reliable accounts of 'North Korean' MiGs being flown by soviet pilots. Still, if you are determined to assert some bogus moral equivalence between invader and invaded, I guess that's your decision. * Comment 84; If North Korea wanted to secretly attack South Korea, why would it use torpedoes which could easily be identified as its own? * Now, that is *quality* paranoia. Do you always reason - for want of a better word - like that? So after Bloody Sunday back in 1972, we find British Army 7.62mm bullets in the dead Republicans...but surely the British would not use 'their own' bullets, so the shootings must have been carried out by the (Americans/Israelis/Reptiods/Bavarian Illuminati, enter your favourite fantasy villain here). * They (the North Korean Navy) used one of their own torpedoes because that's what their submarines are armed with. Remember we're talking a sophisticated acoustic homing guided weapon, tied into the boat's fire control computer. It would be next to impossible to fire anyone else's torpedo, even assuming the DPRK navy could acquire such a thing.

The events which took place is not enough for war, these are conflicts that can still be manage and the UN should not allowed it escalate into war because as a result it might turn to world war. Let there be peace making and peace promotions right now between the countries. CHINA and RUSSIA should keep off from supports to one side because their supports to one side is not for peace. The CHINESES and RUSSIANS should assist the UN to unite both countries.

			"I'm British and have lived in the Republic of Korea for the past seven years (I use the term ?Republic of Korea? over South Korea, since I, and most Koreans I speak to, do not see themselves as North and South, as those in the International Community designate it) and suspect, like many here do, that the submarine sinking was simply another false flag terror event a la 7/7 and 9/11. It wouldn?t surprise me if the C.I.A were involved, as usual, as agitators, to needle the same fools that have existed here for generations to further their own interests that have little to do with Korean national sovereignty and re-unification. This stuff only matters to the same few Koreans who imagine themselves as ?international? and influential, and who have no knowledge or interest in their own culture and the truth of a history that has been repeatedly re-modelled along ?international? lines. They will even call themselves liberals and humanitarians without examining themselves toward the realization that they?re simply insecure and in need of the reassurances of feeling ?global? or ?intellectual?. But perhaps the times will cleanse their ceaseless efforts toward the same idiotic political ladder. The media here is probably more tightly controlled than in the U.K (which is pretty much objectively useless too) and, here, most do not give a damn about what is reported, since it is always international-community leaning propaganda, highly influenced, and partly modeled on, top U.S media institutions that designates South and North, and that takes on all the petty prejudices about the North that the 'international community' does (for the most part this means global media network biases). Although I?m happy that one person mentioned that the media here has reported that the torpedo was a ?South Korean? torpedo. Regardless of who did it, and any information that is presented to you, rather than you having to dig for it... I would take all of this with a large pinch of salt. Meaning, I get tired of what all say about ?the North? since it is never the North that has a say in it. The whole thing has bored me for a very long time. ",
			"I am tired of this ?chattering of children? outside the blacked out window which is a country whose identity is only the identity projected onto it. The North is what it is because the rest of Korea, and the rest of the world, is what it is. I find it amazing that the international community?s media can call the North a ?tyrannical regime? when the rest of the globe is slowly becoming ?a tyrannical regime? with eroded constitutions and ridiculously arrogant and fascist leaders. I also find it strange that people can isolate out the North as tyrannical when, here, the same dictatorships have existed since the end of WWII. Perhaps the only arguable exception toward peace might be at the turn of the century under the presidency of Kim Dae Jung, who also encouraged reunification and visited the North on a highly symbolic visit... and even at this time the country was being pummeled economically by the I.M.F (bankers, I?ve found, hate Korea?s attempts at reunification, because it means independence from their pernicious control). I pontificated on and partially predicted, at the end of last year, that the new world order would need 'an event' that would get Korea in on the police-state oppressions that are being carried out elsewhere, and, in the form of Lee Myung Bak, the South?s president, they have a man cowardly and despotic enough to go along with this nonsense, as well as a corporate infrastructure which will push the same propaganda. I wouldn?t be surprised, either, that the recent suicide of ex-president Roh Moo Hyun will prove to be something very different than a suicide. The baiting and agitation of the main news networks surrounding Roh Moo Hyun, most Koreans here, thought suspicious. Roh Moo Hyun, behind Kim Dae Jung, was a well respected president here, particularly with the young, who, more than partially, voted him into power. ",
			"Fortunately the internet has developed major sensitivity to the uselessness of mainstream media and the majority of people I speak to use the internet for their information, thankfully shielding them from the spin that the media will put on this event. I can?t comment in detail on the submarine incident except to say that it is part of the ongoing campaign to divide and to isolate people (north and south)... to make them feel helpless in the face of seemingly ?inevitable wars?. The elite are scared to death that Kim Jong-il will die and leave the country with the strong ability to re-unite. This is why a puppet is now in power and the propaganda operations continue unabetted. But don?t expect to hear much of this in the majority of the English speaking news media in Korea (if you?re curious enough to look it up on the internet). Much of this news media has been slowly excluding the voice of any open-minded analysis over the seven years I?ve lived here (particularly those of clued-in foreigners who have been reduced to happy @#$%py smiley faces who, now and again, comment on issues of English TEFL teaching OR generalized articles by visiting elected professors who know nothing of Korean culture or identity beyond the bounds of what the ?international community? has fed to them for a large part of their adult lives. If there is going to be a ?war? here then, as usual, it will have nothing to do with the people who live here or in the north and everything to do with the few idiots who work in government here who will betray their people without a second thought, and the plans of the new world order elite who imagine they can get away with anything they like. ",
			"It might even be that they have planned a Korean ?re-unification? on their own tyrannical terms, and on the template of the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Berlin wall. It would be interesting to look for significant dates in this regard, to discover what they may have planned for this peninsula. Remember, they are globalists who are looking to ?unite? Asia under the message of peace (which is perpetual war) and under the aegis of U.N humanitarianism (with covert police state measures as the main hidden focus, and there is definitely not enough security cameras around here for their liking) so look for the consolidation of countries, the undermining of laws and sovereignty, and the same overriding ideological agenda, and the same agenda-peddling on the parts of the NGOs. But people make up all institutions and change toward true peace is able throughout all avenues of social engagement. ",
			"Fools rush in indeed. Iraq is a prime example of just that. However, if North Korea thinks it can continually get away with the likes of the torpedo attack it has another thing coming. Here's a pertinent question, how do you enact 'regime change' without war? ",

			"ROBERTWHITEHAND .... What a terrible thing to say. That the Americans would dream up such a sneaky murdering plot on its own allies navy (South Korea), just to provoke a war against its sworn enemy. How far fetched and there is no evidence to support it ... other than backing Hitler and the Nazi's and financing them in WWii. Then also backing the British in the second part of the war. But was very profitable in German Bonds and sales of weapons and materials - Ok ... I admit there was also false reporting to their own senate about WMD's in IRAQ, although a meeting in Jordan, prior to the invasion, with a top military Iraqi General, who was an informant, warned them there were actually no WMD's. - OK ... Maybe they did have something to do with the Coup in Thaiwan in about 96 where they placed their own leader in a takeover. -- Perhaps they did the same in Afganistan under the guise of 9/11. Tracking Obama Binnie through the desert, who's family just happened to be best buddies with BUSH and family. But this is only circumstancial evidence .. ISN'T it???????? ",

			"I tend to agree with hugaoagogo and danibq in that there is more to this situation and the preceeding incident of the ship sinking than meets the eye. There always is. This situation has been manipulated by members of the richest families in the world, such as the Rosthchilds, Rockefeller, Warburg and DuPonts to name a few. Between them (13 families I believe) they own the main banks of the world and the major oil and gas companies, etc, etc. They hide behind most western governments but it is their plans for world domination, globalisation and the bringing in of the New World Order that drives the policies and behaviour of these governments. They are experts in the art of False Flag attacks such as 9/11, Pearl Harbour and the Bay of Tolkin. Not to mention London 7/7 and Bali amongst others. The South Korean ship sinking sounds like another. There are other countries on their hitlist such as Venezuela and Iran. They also have plans for humanity. Boy do they have plans! Check it out on the web. David Icke is right about alot of things, wait and see.......... ",
			"You know what, the US needs to stay out of other people's business!! Every big news article about wars and conflicts.. involves the US! They need to stop playing Super Cops and sort out their own country with its how many murders per day, drug smuggling, firearms, ghettos, etc. Madness, pure madness! How can they expect to run the world when they can't even run their own. Too much greed in this world! Everyone needs to start working together, accepting the pyramid style rule cause that's the only way it can be - at least in some countries you have a chance at getting near the top depending on how hard you work to get there, and then we can progress as a race (human race) instead of stalling all efforts through diplomacy and all that bulls**t! Maybe a new world order is in need, but one that's actually based on morals and progression rather than greed and capitalization. We need to be One World rather than A Lot of Different Countries. China and Russia are against the US cause they're too power hungry and untrustworthy. The majority of American ppl are not that intelligent, its no surprise that the people in power regularly manipulate them. I don't know anything about how it is in Korea, but surely they can act civilized and get to the bottom of it all, if not then a fight is inevitable. Maybe they should be left to sort it out themselves, may the best man win! Two societies that hate each other can't possibly exist side by side forever. ",

The population have no idea about the outside world as they are not allowed to find out, it is doubtful if they know the world cup in South africa is about to start. The propaganda machine tells them they are the best country in the world, where they have more then the western countries and we are the antagonistic aggressor. Everything the regime in that country does is to keep the powerful in control, while at the same time keeping the poor, poor and ill informed. Why does a country that small, with the backing of China need a million strong army, why does it threaten war when critircised. And for those who think the south sunk it's own ship, get a brain. ",

I am a truck driver, at 6pm i put on R4 for the news i then listen to the comedy at 6.30. In between programmes they will advertise progs coming up, some of them give you information about politics, countries, the NHS etc, you can learn so much from the radio. I heard a radio do@#$%entry about North Korea and how the population is treated, they are force fed propaganda on a daily basis and not allowed any outside contact at all, even the chinese who help them are kept at arms length from the north koreans in case they are told the truth. They treat the people as slaves, don't believe me, well try and get a visa and visit the country as a tourist, the people you are allowed to meet have been brainwashed, and you will have security police making sure you don't talk to the ordinary people.

			"What strikes me about the pictures of the torpedo is that it appears to have been in the sea for quite some time. Is it not possible that it was just lying there,or floating there,Do they float??? waiting to be detonated by a passing ship. I just cant see what N Korea hoped to gain by deliberately torpedoing a S Korean ship. Did they hope it would be an unexplained sinking. What benefit would that be to the North,none that I can think of and they are still denying they were to blame. The North,and the South, full know that No one will gain if it ends in a war. It might end up as one Korea but at what cost. I also cant see what S Korea hoped to gain by blaming N Korea without evidence to back it up or deliberately or accidentely sinking their own ship and then blaming N Korea for it. At the moment it is still heated words being traded and let hope it stays that way. The various sanctions can be lifted at any time as they have in the past.. Why the two Koreas cant live peacefully side by side beats me. Hopefully both sides see this is the best way soon but mind you there are plenty of local wars going on right now without much being done about it and world wide wars have started for less. And Jamejunrit, if YOU have seen heaven to know it is better then you are the only one that has. You wont be going there anyway,its not big enough, Paradise earth is for you and you already live on it if only we humans would take care of it better. Humans cause wars, nearly always in the name of some god or other,but it is greedy pig headed humans to blame all the time. ",
			"With the latest incident with Israel and an aid ship (in apparently international waters) resulting in 19 dead. the Korean situation may well become a side show. On our own doorstep one country holds another in an economic and geographical stranglehold. The occupying nation decides what goes in or out (if anything) and uses the terrorist threat as it's reason. Where have we seen the removal of liberties in the name of security before. - Perhaps we should have built a wall around Northern Ireland during the troubles and demolished whole towns when an IRA bomb went off in the UK. - Come along Israel - you want to be treated as civilised. Act it. ",
			"Mickey Finn, the Russians were directly involved in the Korean War supplying arms and equipment. Also, their pilots were training the previously ill-trained NK pilots how to fly the donated MiG's. How do you think the Communists had a better kill ratio in the first few months of the war. This all changed when the F86 Sabres showed up on the Korean peninsula. The Russians also did the same for the North Vietnamese. I read recently that this current problem is being linked to Kim Il Jongs son. In order for the country to transition to a new leader, some form of military/political clout is needed to influence the largely impoverished and ignorant population. Just as his father did by directing the explosion of a KAL airliner. ",

Well ponder on this. Has anyone considered that YOUR children might become part of this if it does escalate to a war? If negotiations do fall face down your children might be sent to their deaths... But it is in our nature to kill is it not? Besides, the last great war was a long time ago and the earth is getting overpopulated. What would it take to eaze the numbers out a bit?

Both ideologies the enemy to all rational and logical thinking beings. Both equally dangerous dogmas. You need to wake up and drag yourself into the real world, just like the slaves of north Korea, into a world of freedom without the fear of any maniacal supreme overlord. ",
			"Some of the conspiracy theories on this blogg are simply 'off the wall'. The Chinese economy is so dependant on trade with the West it could not afford to side with North Korea or get involved in a war. The solution, it seems to me is if all the representatives of the 191 nations that make up the UN got off their fat backsides and actually did something useful, there will be no war breaking out in Korea. Equally there would have been no Gulf wars, Balkan wars and certainly with a concentrated effort by 191 nations, the middle East crisis could have been avoided if greedy Israel storm troopers had been forced out of the Palestinian land they illegally occupy. ",
			"I agree entirely with the dude. However I think it is an attempt by the North to have political backing at a time when the government is socially and economically unacceptable. The only folk to gain from this will be the south. I think someone should quietly take that idiot out and prevent a war. Preferably someone who has the real interests of the North at heart. Then the south should help the North to become more civilised and less isolated from the rest of the world. This should be accompanied by China, who should help financially to stabalise the region,without attaching some sort of political gain. That would show reason and humanity. Not fear war and poverty......which will be the result of any violence. All this is an old mans attempt to stay in power........another idiot old duffer.

			"I read this morning that it was the youngest son of Kim Jong il that gave the order to sink the south's ship as he is in charge of the north's navy which makes a mockery of their denying it. He is also going to take over when his old man kicks the bucket so what is he going to be like when he has all the toys to play with ie. Atom bombs. These petty dictators have never had anything done to them in their lives they have had everything they have always asked for and see themselve's as some sort of gods, they are just amimal's with no knowledge of what's right or wrong so it is going to take the civilised world to teach them a thing or two.

			"North Korea is engaged in it's usual brinkmanship in order to manipulate aid from the international community and prop up their failed dictatorship. The nuclear cul de sac they have found themselves in is as a result of pressure form China.

Thousands of torpedos have been fired before in that area how do you tell that it is that specific one that sunk the ship? How about american subs dropping that piece as evidence in sting operations? Why would that piece remain intact in that magnitude of explosion? too many unanswered question.A new war would take away attention from Afghanistan and Iraq ",
			"I don't think the North Koreans are so stupid as to condone the torpedoing of a South Korean warship. That is such a blatant act of war that they couldn't hope to get away with it.

			"It maybe that the torpedo attack remains unresoved but I doubt it but one thing is very clear the North Korean regime is a brutal dictatorship who has little regard for its own people or their welfare. Whilst the west has made some unforgivable errors of judgement this regime is one that justifies world wide condemination and the act of saving face by China is not helpful when dealing with a despotic regime. ",
			"Can the avoid war? Let's hope so. Much as I hate the North Korean regime and would love to see it smashed and the people liberated from the propaganda of that backwards idiot and his equally backwards father, North Korea comes across as trigger happy as hell and you get the impression if the Americans (because lets face it, as per usual they're the ones who'll push hardest for war) go in there NK will go down in flames, spraying missiles in all directions. I live in Japan and fully expect NK would target here as well as just the South, probably any country they can reach. Cut them off, lay on a proper trade siege and wait until they're forced to seek help. Starting a war might save a lot of North Koreans from suffering but thousands more will die in neighbouring countries. Despite their poverty, they have the fifth largest army in the world. They would take some beating. ",
			"I want to start by saying that I'm all for North Korea being held accountable for it's actions, if China and Russia agree that it was indeed the North that started the agression, however I think that if America wants to get involved in yet another war let them do it alone! Their international policy has always been to strong arm their way into getting what they want - look at when they first came to Japan, the Japanese told them where to go so America turned up with guns and forced them into a trade agreement. How long has America gone without fighting somekind of war somewhere far enough away that their homeland is at minimal risk? They never force their ideas of freedom and democray, which are a joke compared to most of liberal Europe or Canada, on their own neighbours or S.America because the risk of them taking a hit is too great! No, much easier to play far away countires off eachother or start a war and then when things get too hot just run away. The UK really needs to make a stand on this one and tell our allies that we appriciate our special relationship but we're sick of being dragged into their war mongering. We're not a bunch of saints by any means, the Falklands and troubles in Ireland etc. However it seems to me that we aren't getting much out of our relationship with the US anymore other than an increased risk of our own people getting killed; we don't even get immigration benefits like we have with EU countries even though we've been best buds and backed the US for so long. Time for us to put the Great back in GB and leave America to play it's silly yet deadly games. ",
			"Why do people assume that if it wasn't the North Koreans who sank the ship, it must have been South Korea who did the dirty on their own sailors? Who else has a previous track record on this kind of incident, and who could gain most if, in consequence, N Korea was finally isolated from China for it's aggression. Why it's good ole Uncle Sam. Remember the Gulf of Tonkin incident - not so far away - when the USS Maddox was supposedly attacked by N Vietnamese patrol boats and as a result of which, the war against N Vietnam was ratcheted up enormously to deter further N Vietnamese aggression. Or how about the sinking of the USS Maine in Havana, the result of which was the Spanish American war which gained the US Cuba & the Philippines as colonies. And who else has the technology to have a submarine in place and undetected? I'll be surprised if S Korea has, but the US certainly has. I am not saying the US did it but.... As history shows, it does have a track record! ",
			"Currently I am living in Korea and reading the international news about this situation is alarming. The rest of the world prepare for this war whilst the Koreans are fully confident there will be no war. I have some friends in the military over here who cannot foresee any war in the near future. I cannot imagine China wanting to go into war right now. Some intrnational newspapers have a way of sensationalising situations, almost willing it. There will be repurcussions. There has to be, but war? All quiet on the Eastern front. ",

Unlike the reunification of of Germany, Korea will be like Vietnam, it will mean a very bitter war will have to be fought. When war does break out it could turn into something much bigger than the world would want to see. As for the UK taking part in the conflict, there isn't much chance of that. We haven't got an army big enough to send there, what with the streached commitment we have in Afganistan. I know we all shout SAS and all is right. But in a modern, heavily armoured and air power war that will be unleashed, then that is fantasty. To fight a modern ground war you need men and material on the ground. And that's something we haven't got. The UK is not prepared for a war that will be fast moving and brutal. ",

Seven years on we're still waiting for those weapons of mass destruction to turn up in IRAQ. .OBAMA take note,don't lure into war because of facts that dose not exist. It wouldnt suprise me in the least if this was a conspiracy by the US and its allies in the region to put further pressure on the North to comply with their demands to date. Could well be a classic case of subterfuge to establish justification for sanctions and/or military action. Im not defending the North by any stretch of the imagination,I see them as the greater of two evils but dont be suprised if my assumptions are correct. Afterall,these are the same tactics America employed to generate the brief but significant conflict in South Ossetia 2 years ago. Significant as it lead to the likes of Poland and Ukraine signing papers allowing the US to build a missile shield on their territory with the missiles all pointed at Russia,a plan the States had been trying to enact for years. Making Russia look like the aggressors 'justified' this action. The simple,age old and effective strategy of divide and conquer at work - a strategem the ruling class have been perfecting for years. Whether you agree with me or not on exactly why or how the sinking happened,I would definately argue that one way or another,war with North Korea is inevitable,or should i say,military operations will resume and by that stage it wont matter whos right or wrong because the same thing will happen as it does in all wars. Lots of poor people are sent out to kill lots of other poor people while the super rich super elite @#$% who instigate these wars sit back,roll their sleeves up and make plans for rebuilding what they destroy at a massive profit. Theyre ALL bastrads - some have just become far more sophisticated than others at hiding it. The sinking of this ship could well have been subterfuge. And if it wasnt,as ive said,it wont matter to the people who die as a result of the actions of the ruling class. It only matters to the profiteers when the show can finally roll. ",

In case you are, can I respectfully point out that Israel has sought to board a series of private aid vessels, Turkish based, the intention of these vessels being to draw international attention to the alleged plight of the residents of the Gaza strip, hopefully in the process causing Israel much embarrassment. In that, it appears to have achieved it's aim. :: Naturally, the Israelis - always as subtle as the proverbial poke in the eye with a sharp stick, chose to board these vessels in international waters, rather than the exclusion zone around Gaza, and this decision they will have to justify to the international community in due course. That they have managed to kill nine civilians in the process is both tragic and regrettable, but in no way do today's actions in the Eastern Med equate to the truly horrendous Japanese attack upon Pearl Harbor which killed near on 2,500 US military and civilian personnel, who were not offering such a blatent challenge to the Japanese as this Aid convoy was to the Israelis. :: I do not begin to understand why dropping a pair of nuclear weapons on Tel Aviv and Jerusalem proves one values the lives of one's offspring, or how such an action could in any way benefit them, but I can, and do, assure you that the people of Gaza [and Jordan, Egypt, Syria and the Lebanon] would not.

			"First of all you need to read this report on the sinking of this vessel. The description is that of a mine sinking and not a torpedo sinking, and could of been a mine laid down by the British, Americans, Australians or even the Japs in the WWII or could of been a mine set down by the Americans in the Korean war of 1950 to 1953 many of those mines was not recovered after the wars, most are just forgotten about and left to just rot away, Where I live we are still finding mines in the water from WWII and are still very active. What give this away off being a mine and not a torpedo is the facts of lack of jagged edges to the hole, and it was a bubble mass of the explosion that sunk the vessels. Torpedo's leave a gaping hole that is very jagged and the explosion is force into the vessel with very little bubble mass. Mines how ever work different they are designed in such way to lift to break the back of a ship and lots of bubble mass to change the water tension to sink the vessel and if the mine is close it will leave a small hole with very few jagged edges. And if you read the report it describe a mine sinking. The Americans have been spoiling for a war with North Korea because of the off shore oil on the coast of North Korea for a number of years. ",

Between them (13 families I believe) they own the main banks of the world and the major oil and gas companies, etc, etc. They hide behind most western governments but it is their plans for world domination, globalisation and the bringing in of the New World Order that drives the policies and behaviour of these governments. They are experts in the art of False Flag attacks such as 9/11, Pearl Harbour and the Bay of Tolkin. Not to mention London 7/7 and Bali amongst others.

As for China, theres too much to loose in exports if they fall out with USA by backing North Korea, as well as the ties South Korea and China established in 1992 and have been working on (and gaining strength since then).

			"from Ancient Soldier. Crime scenes as we know can be set up to convey certain signals or to trigger certain desired reactions which can ignite wars or create witch hunts' I am a military correspondent, who unlike most, have served many years, some on active service and under fire , and I have a wide hands-on experience of various kinds of weaponry, including items used in naval warfare. Only morons would accept that the convemeitn finding of a complete propeler shaft and motor assembly would be retrievable complete after a torpedo had impacted with a ship's hull and exploded, unlesss the warhead had been filled with marshmallow. And how convenient that the serial numbers and marks showed that the torpedo was made in a North Korean factory. Given the global situation tense wirh tumours of wars , would North Korea, given its pariah status in the so-called 'developed' countries,like the UK with its 'Arthur or Martha' government, confusions, seek to start a war by such a provocative action ? The two invasions of Iraq and were both based on false evidences and assertions, and agents provocateur carry out bombings and atrocities to justify even more violent reactive measures such as wars and the imposition of extreme regimes. Both North and South Koreans must recognise they are members of one nation , and both have much to gain realizing that there are interests hard at work wishing to destroy.a nation which will become very successful and productive when ineffectual politics are set aside. so that the Yin and Yang wheel on flag of the former united Korea represents the perfect interlocking of the Ki existence. Come guys, both North and South - try working together, and think about that 'perfect' evidence. - very likely planted to get a war going. A Military Correspondent, Undeliably, the wilful sinking of the South Korean patrol vessel was a sick act, as was the sinking of the 'Belrgano' in the rigged Falklands war. ",
			"To bfsoundcollective on Sun May 30 04:23PM. I understand that you consider my statements religious clap-trap. It was not my intention to peddle religious views. It appeared to me that many of the comments were taking on a dooms day out look with regard to possible world war developing. My intention was to offer peace to those who may be feeling fearful. In inviting them to consider world events in the light of the hope God offers His people. It is as you say, many have lost their life in the name of God. Question is, were they acting on behalf of God or using God as a reason to wage war to achieve their own desires? Your correct that here is not the correct forum for religious views. I apologizes for upsetting you or anyone else. But the fact remains. God offers comfort and hope to those who choose to believe in Him. ",
			"The result of this happening seems the lacking of loving each other.All human beings look at appearance, which offers selfish interest. Before your pointing out both Koreas please do look at your heart!!!!!!! Most of People who here critisize Koreas have been belonged to great sinful men, who have deveolped both Communism and Democratism. Badly speaking, Koreas have been devided as lambs of secrifice by two isms, which was made by great sinful nations/men. Thus all men should surely need to repent (metanoeowhat they have done without fearing the Creator God. Oh, Lord God! Forgive our sins against the heart of Love, Faith and Hope of the future! As long as there is hope in us, there is prayer to overcome what we have recently been situated in front of us. If there is prayer from our heart, there shall be God who leads us to the understanding after our experiencing self denial and each cross. Amen! Please, Love deeply! ",
			"world war 3 started well over 20 years ago,due to the use of LOW INTENSITY CONFLICT wich was designed to prevent WARGASM(global anihilation through war) its not seen as one big war but loads o smaller ones the world over,instigated by multinational companies provocating all sides with religion,race,class poverty etc,makin vast amounts of cash suplying all sides wiv weapons,thats where and who might be behind the torpedo. for example in ww2 lever (aka unilever,lever brothers) a multinat' that make persil washing powder also sold weapons,rations and clothing to the german forces as well as the allies, they also were influential to the aparthites in s africa. the presidents, primeministers and heads of alot of religions are just puppets....oh yeah jamejunret and you other mathew 24 babblers 4got the bit many will come in FALSE representation of my name,claiming they are the word of christ and that their's is the way,and not be decieved by them,hmmm! i wish you all peace love and bangin tunes! lol ",
			"oh yeah! Its always tye bloody yanks that come out with the god loves you @#$%. Ok really you all need to go amsterdam and pay a dirty hooker 50 euro's to let you treat her like the dirty @#$%s they are. yanks start more wars than anyone else and always need us brits to save you. never heard of the saying dont start what you cant @#$% finish you stupid @#$%s! ",
			"A lesson from history in that this torpedo scenario has all the hallmarks of the Gulf of Tonkin incident in the Vietnam War. Could it be that a third party, independent contractor to the Pentagon arranged for the firing of this torpedo? Stanger things have happened. ",
			"Foreign wars are great for the american Military contractor. Don't expect to see the US trying to end any wars any time soon, especially those on foreign ground. It is far to lucrative for the businessmen who supply the military machine. The same businessmen who put most of the politicians in place. Nope, wars are here to stay. Because they make big business and earn huge profits, and the tax payers foot the bill. ",
			"well we have all lived on this crest of a wave for many years,theres a deep hole let bury our heads,good plan ummmmmmmmmmwe need a war to cut the worlds population,we can not feed 6.6 billion,before the last world war the land available to grow food produced,a lot less than, the same ground as to produce now,but we havent got the same growing land as we did before the last war,as people/houses/and roads ect have all taken our growing lands people have increased,so the most sensibly thing to do is cut the population have a world war,after all its is our human right to have a war,if history is to be believed,we have always had wars,so why not, shake a few of the do-gooders up,bring it on war the only thing the world understands,then after its all over we can produce stupid posters saying all kinds of stupid things about war,good plan ",
			"Thank you, archaelogia for your well-considered, cogently-argued and humane plan for solving the planet's problems. While we're still agog, why not tell us how you'd tackle climate change, the banking crisis and England's desperate need for a world-class striker. Oh, and if you could suggest a cure for the common cold, that would be lovely too... ",
			"Um! a question? are power games being played out in south Korea to the point of causing a war with the north it all seem to convenient, after all there are two sides to every story espeically in this power ungry world that we live in, and has there seems to be more things going on here than meets the eye therefore perhaps we should question everything and believe nothing ",
			"Russia did aid north korea in the korean war, it was during the cold war. the US, under the pretence of the UN took advantage of Russia's boycott (thus unable to veto) and went into Korea on the side of the South. It is possible that this could all be staged by the South just as China faked the explosion in on the South Manchurian Railway just before the 2nd World War. Howeva, it is not logical for South Korea to want war because surely it knows that because of the Russo-American pact signed by obama n his russian counterpart in March, she will have no american backing should war erupt. North Korea is in possession of Nuclear Arms, what chance does good, law-abiding, industrialised South Korea have??? ",
