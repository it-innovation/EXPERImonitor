Packaging the ECC component (using Maven 3.x+)
----------------------------------------------

1) mvn clean
  
  Then you should (but this is optional) manually delete the contents from:
    * ./doc/javaDoc
    
2) mvn install

3) mvn site -PreportECC

  This should generate a set of reports in:
    ./target/site/
    
  - Check the reports for consistency before then...

4) mvn license:aggregate-add-third-party -Dlicense.useMissingFile

  * This should generate a summary of licenses required for ECC compilation in:
      ./target/generated-sources/license/THIRD-PARTY.txt
      
  * Ensure that all the appropriate license files can be found in:
      ./licences
      
  * Update the IPR file:
      ./IPR.txt

5) mvn clean

6) build the html documentation:

  cd doc
  make html
      
7) mvn package -PpackageECC

  * This will build and package up the ECC component in a ZIP file:
    ./target/experimedia-arch-ecc-<VERSION>-src.zip
   
   and should include:
   
     * Everything you find in this directory
     * Generated JavaDoc in ./doc/javaDoc/
