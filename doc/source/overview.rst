Overview
========

The Experiment Content Component (ECC) comprises several modules:

* :doc:`Experiment Specification (ES)</experiment-specification>`: Plays an executive role in the specification and control of experiments. User views in the ES allow the experimenter to describe where experiment resources are located, enter specific configurations for an experiment and control the overall experiment life-cycle.

* :doc:`Experiment Deploy & Configure (EDC)</experiment-deploy-config>`: The principal role of this component is the automatic (or semi-automatic) deployment and configuration of experimental resources specified by the ES. The EDC manages the boot-strapping process of resource installation and subsequent configuration in collaboration with the experimenter.

* :doc:`Experiment Security Correctness (ESC)</experiment-security>`: Components connected to the ECC have associated security models that the ESC is able to check to evaluate security threats for a particular experimental specification. Experimenters are able to explore a variety of attack scenarios using these models.

* :doc:`Experiment Monitor (EM)</experiment-monitor>`: Monitoring of both the experimental resource status and the experimental metrics generated by those resources is managed by the EM. It queries components deployed by the EDC for metric generating capabilities and gathers that data at run-time.

* :doc:`Experiment Data Manager (EDM)</experiment-data-manager>`: The EDM manages the access and persistence of metric data collected by the EM. Storage of this data is allocated on a per-experiment basis and metrics can be accessed within a time-frame for subsequent analysis.

Interactions between the ECC components
---------------------------------------

**EDC/ES interactions:**
The interactions between the EDC and ES are predominantly for the purpose of ‘boot-strapping’ the technical resources required for an experiment to take place. The experimenter will use the ES specification files to describe the location of resources (software installation locations) and their intended targets (cloud based compute and storage/networked hardware), as well as specifying the configuration elements for each of these. The EDC will then handle the execution of deployment, configuration, and tear-down procedures based on this specification and report the results.

**EDC/ESC interactions:**
The deployment and specification process will interact with the security sub-component; the EDC will provide the security models that are associated with experiment technology resources it manages to the ESC. Subsequently, these security models can be viewed by the experimenter using the ESC component and evaluated for potential threats (see below).

**ESC/ES interactions:**
The ES component encapsulates a collection of security models generated during the experiment deployment and configuration process; these models (representing EXPERIMEDIA components) can be checked by the experimenter using the security correctness tool. Additionally, the experimenter will be able to explore various ‘attack scenarios’ based on the experimental set-up she has specified using the ESC component.

**ES/EDM interactions:**
Internally, the ES component supports the deployment and configuration process associated with the EDM by specifying the data persistence resources (such as a `Postgres`_ database service) that can be used to store experimental data (the installation source/target information of which must be provided by the experimenter).

**EM/EDC interactions:**
The EM component deploys a number of monitoring views for the experimenter to review during the course of an experiment. Some of these views (for example, the experiment resource view) may be implemented using a third party system (such as `NAGIOS`_). To this end, the EDC is used to deploy and configure these monitoring systems such that the EM can direct monitoring data traffic to them.

**EDC/EDM interactions:**
As described above (see ES/EDM interactions), the EDC plays an important role in the deployment and configuration of data management systems that will allow the EDM to store and provide access to experimental (metric) data. During experiment initialization, the EDM is configured by the EDC to use the database resources specified by the experimenter.

**ES/EM interactions:**
The relationship between the ES and EM is principally concerned with the specification of the technical systems that will be used during the monitoring run-time of the experiment. In a similar pattern to that described above, the ES specifies the EM installation source/target information required for its deployment, including the provision of the AMQP bus service.
