Overview
========

The Experiment Content Component (ECC) comprises several modules:

* :doc:`Experiment Specification </experiment-specification>`: Plays an executive role in the specification and control of experiments. User views in the ES allow the experimenter to describe where experiment resources are located, enter specific configurations for an experiment and control the overall experiment life-cycle.

* :doc:`Experiment Deploy & Configure </experiment-deploy-config>`: The principal role of this component is the automatic (or semi-automatic) deployment and configuration of experimental resources specified by the ES. The EDC manages the boot-strapping process of resource installation and subsequent configuration in collaboration with the experimenter.

* :doc:`Experiment Security Correctness </experiment-security>`: Components connected to the ECC have associated security models that the ESC is able to check to evaluate security threats for a particular experimental specification. Experimenters are able to explore a variety of attack scenarios using these models.

* :doc:`Experiment Monitor </experiment-monitor>`: Monitoring of both the experimental resource status and the experimental metrics generated by those resources is managed by the EM. It queries components deployed by the EDC for metric generating capabilities and gathers that data at run-time.

* :doc:`Experiment Data Manager </experiment-data-manager>`: The EDM manages the access and persistence of metric data collected by the EM. Storage of this data is allocated on a per-experiment basis and metrics can be accessed within a time-frame for subsequent analysis.
